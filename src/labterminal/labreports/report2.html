										We have started to introduce live subjects to the unidentified matter to see how the matter reacts. We introduced 4 ants to the sample and it quickly latched onto the ants when they came into close proximity to the matter as expected. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										What happened next was unprecedented. Over the course of a mere 20 minutes the ants had doubled in size. Further more, 1 of the ants was rapidly metamorphosing into a queen and within 2 hours of contact with the matter was already laying eggs. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										When we attempted to isolate the queen for further study the other ants would surround her. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										This leads us to believe that this matter is not actually a virus, but is in fact a parasite with self-preservation as its mandate. It appears to use its hosts to spread itself into as many organic lifeforms as possible and is controlled via some sort of 'hive mind'. Normally a parasite would eat away at the host from the inside, however this one seems different. It would appear as though this parasite is making the hosts physically stronger, and using the hosts body as a shell. How this affects the subjects minds is still yet to be determined - ants are difficult to test on in this regard.
