										Unidentified composition found on the Asteroid 9254 Sceptri II. A small percentage of this composition was found in a 300mm core sample which was also composed of Iron whOre, Granite, H20, and Sulphur. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										Under microscopic investigation in the quarantine chamber it has been found that this unidentified composition is actually fossilized organic matter. As the core sample was harvested in sub-zero temperatures, I have brought it up to ambient temperature to monitor any change in the matter. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										When brought to ambient room temperature this microscopic organic matter shows signs of movement and reacts when coming into closer proximity to other organic matter, such as my hand. It's strange as it can sense this even through the thick rubber glove. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										Is this a new discovery of life or a virus? I will continue to conduct tests over the next few days
