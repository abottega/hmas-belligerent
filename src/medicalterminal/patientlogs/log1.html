										Emergency: Laceration to arm.

										Emergency procedure to treat 15cm Laceration to right arm.
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										I administered laser cauterize treatment to seal wound and tetanus injection to prevent infection.
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										The incident which led to the wound, as described by Freddy, was that the plants in the air purification chamber attacked him as he went to trim them. This seems highly illogical from a scientific perspective.
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										In addition to the injury, Freddy has noticably flared up sinuses, and has been sneezing and coughing throughout this treatment.
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										Due to suspected parasite spread I took this opportunity to collect a blood sample. Test confirmed that there is a foreign body in his blood test results, similar to Lenaina.   
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										It would appear that my worst fears have been realised. This organic parasite seems to have spread directly from Lenaina to Freddy. With Freddy's sinus symptoms there is no doubt the parasite would have spread to the crew's food supply in the plants. Perhaps this is why the plants are behaving strangely?
