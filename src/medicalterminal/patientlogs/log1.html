										He is infected with a parasite. Motor reflex normal. Sinuses have flared up. Lots of sneezing and coughing. Ramblings about Ceres.

										I explain that I understand that Lenaina and himself are involved 'romantically'. He gets physically aggressive and tries to deny this accusation.

										Conclude that my worst fears have been realised. This organic parasite would no doubt have spread to the plants (food supply), and I have no doubt it has already infected the crew. It appears to enforce some sort of mind control over the host, trying to hide its existence whilst slowly eating away at the hosts free will. The parasite appears to retain the knowledge of the host and uses it to manipulate and spread itself. Self preservation appears to be the parasites mandate, as there are no signs that the parasite is eating away at the hosts physically.
