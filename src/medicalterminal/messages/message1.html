									<h4>I think we have a problem</h4>

										Hi Encel,
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										I don't want to cause a panic so I thought i'd come to you first. There was an incident in the Lab about 3 weeks ago and one of the rock samples broke out of containment. Lenaina was in the lab at the time and she wasn't wearing her breathing aparatus. After we ran tests on the other rock samples from the same asteroid we discovered a small trace of unknown composition within these. I've run some tests on this composition and can confirm this is an organic parasite like we've never seen before. 
                                    </p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
                                        I haven't yet told Lenaina about my findings as I don't know if she is infected, but this is where I need your help. Could you please run some tests on her to see if there is anything abnormal going on. 
                                    </p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
                                        As i'm sure you understand, this information should remain confidential between us until we have a definitive result. The last thing we want is to cause widespread panic amongst the crew when we don't even fully understand the problem ourselves.
                                    </p>
