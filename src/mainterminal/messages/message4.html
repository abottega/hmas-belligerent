									<h4>Had to move my stuff, AGAIN!</h4>
									<small class="listing__small">306 days ago</small>

										That piece of shit Randy is at me again! I seriously think he has it in for me. It seems like it's always me he's bossing around. Yeah I'm the youngest member on this crew but that's no reason to make me feel like a subordinate. He's made me move all my personal stuff into one of the lockers in the loading bay so he can have more space for his tools... As if he doesn't have enough space for all his shit already!
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										Anyway, feel free to go there to grab 'you know what' if you need. Just make sure you go somewhere discreet to do it and hide them afterwards. I don't want the Cap finding out about this as it'll be more than just your ass in the firing line. x
