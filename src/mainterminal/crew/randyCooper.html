									<h3>Randy Cooper</h3>
									<h4>ENGINEER</h4>
									<p>Age: 34</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Bio:</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Randy Cooper has always been good with his hands, but has been known to have an unorthodox way of doing things. After being terminated from his gynecologist studies as an undergraduate due to gross misconduct, Randy took to the tools in the field of Mechanical Engineering. Spending the first 4 years of his apprenticeship on New Ganymede servicing transport vessels, Randy soon after enlisted in the HMAS Air Fleet as a cadet engineer. 
									</p>
										Known as a hot head with a short fuse, Randy has had his fair share of run-ins with the disciplinary committee. In 3015 Randy was court marshalled after he allegedly jettisoned a fellow crew members luggage out the air lock because she didn't wash her cutlery. When questioned about the incident Randy responded with "We've got no place for filth on this spaceship!". Stone Johnson had Randy's back through this inquisition, stating "We've always run a clean and tight ship, no excuses.".
