									<h3>Encel Butler</h3>
									<h4>DOCTOR</h4>
									<p>Age: 142</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Bio:</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Being originally manufactured in 2913 to service machinery on planets with an uninhabitable atmosphere, Encell was actually dispatched to the planet Draugluin, where he worked for 42 years as a medical aid worker in the front lines, treating the human colonists when they encountered hostile locals. Whilst on Draugluin, Encell had to absorb and process an entirely foreign planet, fauna, flora, atmospheric conditions, weapons, chemistry and provide accurate diagnosis to treat injured humans correctly. Encell has proven he has the ability to absorb unlimited amounts of data and information, and provide accurately analysed medical solutions. With the war on Draugluin concluding early in the 3000th century, Encell has transferred his expertise to deep space research vessels where he will be better suited to his skill sets.
