										<strong>Bio:</strong>
									</p>
									<p>
										Enlisting in the Royal academy at the age of 16, Stone Johnson worked in the Vellos manufacturing plant on Mars as a factory engineer for 6 years - working on the Atlas class vessels. Having successfully completed his compulsory Loaded Gravity Based Trials (LGBT), Stone was re-assigned to the HMAS Antagonist at 22 years of age as 2nd Engineer.
									</p>
										Stone's curiosity drew him to learn more than just his engineering duties, and after requesting additional training he was taken under his Captains wing as 2nd Lieutenant. 
									<p>
										Impressing from the commencement of this role, Stone was reported as an excellent team leader with immense knowledge of the vessel. HMAS Command received glowing recommendations about Mr. Johnson's capabilities, and at the age of 36, Stone was promoted to Captain, and assigned his own vessel, the HMAS Belligerent. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Successfully completing over 10 deep space research missions to date, the most notable being the discovery of rich Iron whOre deposits in the 5770 Delphini System, Captain Stone Johnson received the Medal of Excellence which was personally awarded to him by our leader of the Royal Airforce, Grand Admiral Cage.
