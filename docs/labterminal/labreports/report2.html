									<h4>Lab report 002</h4>

										I have named the unidentified organic matter "Herpesviridae" and have started to introduce live subjects to it to see how the matter reacts. We introduced 4 ants to the sample and it quickly latched onto the ants when they came into close proximity to the matter as expected. It appears to have entered the ants as I no longer see the matter on the surface of the ants. What happened next was unprecedented. Over the course of a mere 2 hours the ants had doubled in size. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										Further more, 1 of the ants was rapidly metamorphosing into a queen and within 6 hours of contact with Herpesviridae she was already laying eggs for the others to inseminate. 
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										When we attempted to isolate the queen for further study the other ants would surround her.
									</p>
									<p class="listing__paragraph">
										This leads us to believe that this matter is not actually a virus, but is in fact a Protozoa type Parasite. It would appear as though this parasite is making the hosts physically stronger, larger, and using the hosts body as a shell. There are also signs that this parasite is employing some sort of hive-mind to communicate, and whilst this is common with ants, what i'm seeing here is much more advanced than any studies i'm aware of. How this affects the subjects minds is still yet to be determined - ants are difficult to test on in this regard.
